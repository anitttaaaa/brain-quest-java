# BrainQuestJava

BrainQuestJava is a project dedicated to learning and practicing Java programming. It serves as a structured and systematic tool for continuous skill development through coding challenges and exercises.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java tasks inspired by programming platforms and learning resources. Each task includes:
- A problem statement
- Constraints and input/output format
- A Java solution with proper implementation

## Getting Started

### Requirements

  To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-compatible IDE)
- Basic understanding of Java syntax and concepts

## How to Run the Project

1. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA**
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open the cloned repository.
   

2. **Navigate to the `com.challenges` package**
    - Locate the package where the tasks are stored (`src/main/java/com/challenges`).
    - Choose a specific task (e.g., `loops.Task1.java`).
   

3. **Run the chosen method inside BrainQuestJavaApplication.java**
    - Open the BrainQuestJavaApplication.java file.
    - Find the method corresponding to the selected task. 
    - Uncomment the method call for the task you want to execute 
    - Run the main method.


## Learning Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills in Java
- Gain hands-on experience with control structures, loops, and algorithms
- Strengthen understanding of Java syntax and best practices
